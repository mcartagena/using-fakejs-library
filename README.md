# using-fakejs-library
This is a exercise to generate fake data in JavaScript with faker.js library. It is based in the tutorial publish in
[The faker.js tutorial](https://zetcode.com/javascript/fakerjs/)

I added the use of faker.lorem.sentence() and faker.lorem.paragraph(), the code is located in generate_users_data.js, to perform the code use these commands:
```
npm i
node generate_users_data.js 
```

It will generate _**dataUsers.json**_ file.
